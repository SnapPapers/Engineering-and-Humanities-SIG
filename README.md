# SnapPapers

## Problem Definition

**Engineering & Humanities SIG members** are facing a **huge learning curve** using the SIG website due to the **lack of collaboration** promotion and the **difficult access** to their papers.

We have observed that there are **not too many SIG members** at the website and the actual website capabilities are confusing.

**If this problem continues, we are not expecting a notable growing rate of collaborations** with SIG members from the public users. So, **the users will be unable to find the related work or profiles** of the Engineering & Humanities SIG members.

Therefore, we need to take a **dynamic approach** by **promoting the integrity** of the SIG council **increasing the research papers' accessibility** and **promoting collaboration** with like-minded individuals based on interests and **geographical location**.

To test our hypothesis, we are **redesigning the SIG website** focusing on **integration, innovation, inclusion and respect for the SIG members**.
