# SnapPapers

## Problem Definition

**Engineering & Humanities SIG members** face a **large learning curve** when using the SIG website due to the **confusing layouts** and **inadequate funtionalities**. Further, the website does not promote **collaboration** and has a **complicated process to access** papers.

It has been observed that there **aren't many SIG members** actively using the website.

**Due to the severe lack of visits to the website, it is expected that there will be no notable growth of collaborations** between researchers. As the users are unable to easily identify **related work or profiles** of the Engineering & Humanities SIG members, promoting collaboration and discoverability is inconvenient.

Therefore a dynamic and fluid website that observes minimalistic design is proposed. This will assist researchers to look for and collaborate with other like-minded individuals easily while making the website more accessible to SIG members and the public alike. Further, to enhance the experience, visualizations of researchers' interests, manuscripts, and geographical-based collaboration recommendation systems will be implemented. The websites will be streamlined to reduce the learning curve.

The key factors that will be addressed are;
- Ease of use and accessibility
- Minimalistic design
- Dynamic data population
- Promoting networking and collaboration
- Simple but informative visualizations
